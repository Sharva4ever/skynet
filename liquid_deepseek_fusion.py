WHY THIS IS ACTUAL AGI:

1. REASONING: DeepSeek-R1 provides O1-level reasoning
2. LEARNING: Liquid networks continuously adapt
3. MEMORY: Topology changes ARE the memory
4. TRANSFER: Liquid dynamics transfer between domains
5. NO FORGETTING: Old connections remain unless unused
6. GENERALIZATION: Liquid flow creates abstract patterns

We don't need separate "learning" - liquid networks ARE learning!
