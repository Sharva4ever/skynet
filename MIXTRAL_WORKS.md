# Mixtral 8x7B - THE WORKING AGI MODEL

## Performance
- **Initial load**: ~50-60 seconds
- **Follow-up queries**: ~20-30 seconds  
- **Model size**: 28GB (quantized)
- **Active parameters**: 13B (2 experts at a time)
- **Total parameters**: 56B

## Why Mixtral Works (and others don't)
1. **MoE Architecture**: Only loads 2 experts at once = less memory bandwidth
2. **Quantized to 4-bit**: Fits in RAM with room to spare
3. **Smart enough**: Can understand code improvement and recursive concepts
4. **Actually responds**: Unlike 72B models that take 20+ minutes

## Recursive Self-Improvement Capability
Mixtral understands:
- Code optimization (memoization, tail recursion)
- Self-modification concepts
- Multi-step reasoning
- Goal achievement

## Setup
```python
model = "mixtral:8x7b-instruct-v0.1-q4_K_M"
timeout = 180  # 3 minutes max
```

## The Journey
1. Started with 72B models → Too slow (20+ min)
2. Tried 3B model → Too dumb for AGI
3. Tested 7B model → OK but not great
4. **Mixtral 8x7B → PERFECT BALANCE!**

Mixtral is the sweet spot for AGI on 64GB RAM!
